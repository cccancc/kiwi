# I'm (mostly) Markdown

Markdown is a simple [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) that lets you easily make things *italic* or **bold** or _underlined_ or whatever you want. The best way to understand Markdown is to look at this text, and then tap the "Edit" button in the top left and see what the Markdown looks like. It takes a little while to get used to, but it's a really easy way to write.

## This is a headline

Here's a _blockquote_:

> Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, "memex" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.

â€” Vannevar Bush, [As We May Think](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)

### This is a smaller headline

To illustrate _lists_ and how they work, here are the days of the week and what their personalities would be like:

* Monday: Grumpy
* Tuesday: Pretty "chill" but also sleepy most of the time
* Wednesday: A Worrier
* Thursday: Enjoys the finer things in life
* Friday: Makes interesting, but groanable puns
* Saturday: Always challenging your opinions and beliefs
* Sunday: Friendly

## Photos

You can add photos from your device by pressing the "Photos" button in the toolbar. You'll notice that photos get inserted with `![](A URL to the photo)`. That means you can include photos from elsewhere like:

## Internal links

Internal links are done with square brackets. For instance, here's a link back [[Home]].

## External links

* [This links to the Wikipedia page Vannevar Bush's Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex)
* [This links to my creator's website](http://markhudnall.com)

## Checkbox lists

- [ ] This is the first thing
- [ ] This is another thing
- [x] This is a completed thing

You can tap the checkbox to complete it.

## Code snippets

Here's how to write code with syntax highlighting:

```python

a = "a syntax highlighted block"
b = "other things"

class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, bar):
        self.bar = bar

foo = Foo("Hello World")
```

To include snippets inline, just `wrap them in backticks`.

## Math

You can write equations in a LaTeX-like syntax:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi
$$

You can write equations inline like $a = 5$.

------------------------

That should get you pretty far. Good luck out there!
