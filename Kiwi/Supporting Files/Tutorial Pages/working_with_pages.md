## The home page

The [[Home]] page (the one you just came from) is your jumping-off point. **You can always get back home by tapping the title of the page you're on and then tapping the cool "house" icon**. This is the only page you can't delete from the app (but pressing the "Trash" icon while editing will clear it completely). Feel free to make it your own.

## Editing pages

To edit a page, **tap the "Edit" button in the top left**.

Try doing that now and typing something after this sentence. Then, press the checkmark to save.

## Adding pages

You can add a page 2 ways:

1. Tap on a [[Link With No Page]].
2. Tap the "+" button in the top right.

## Linking pages

To link a page, use the square brackets. I have a handy toolbar when you're writing that makes this easy for you. You can also alias pages (here's an alias to [[this very page:Working With Pages]]).

## Searching pages

You can view pages chronologically and search them by **tapping the title of the current page** in the navigation bar. You may need to scroll up to see the navigation bar.
