# Hi! I'm Kiwi ðŸ˜Ž

I'm a [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki) that you can use to write, edit, and reflect on your thoughts. You might already use an app for taking notes, so let me tell you why I'm different.

Instead of showing your notes chronologically, I let you **link your notes together** in whatever way makes sense to you. That makes me a flexible, reflective medium for organizing your thoughts and surfacing new ideas.^[1]

If you're like my [creator](http://markhudnall.com), your thoughts aren't chronological and linear â€” they're more like a web. Each thought or idea doesn't necessarily relate to the one before it, but over time, you find that they're connected. When you write with me, you might have a few "Aha" moments where a new idea emerges, or a new connection, and you can link it back to your other thoughts.

That's some pretty heady stuff, but don't worry, not everything you write has to be a Big Idea. My creator uses me for a *lot* of different things:

* A life and ideas journal (the heady stuff)
* A place to take notes on books (whose content might be related)
* A travel journal (with photos)
* A math and programming journal (with `syntax` highlighting and $\KaTeX \ge 0$)
- [x] Anything with a todo list
* A place to keep drafts of publishable writing
* A way to organize basically anything (like trip itineraries or learning resources or recipes)

I shine because of my **flexibility**. I hope you'll find new uses for me that my creator and I couldn't even fathom.

## How to use me

I'm written in Markdown plus some extras, so for a good introduction, check out my page on [[Writing with Kiwi]], which you can then feel free to delete.

Everything you write with me is **automatically synced to Dropbox**, so **you're in control of your notes**. If you want to stop using me, everything you've ever written is already [[Available in Dropbox]].

Other than that, I'm basically just pages. To learn more, check out [[Working with Pages]].

## That's all, folks.

I'm really excited to be your companion and help you through the good, bad, and the beautiful. If you have any questions or just want to chat, reach out to my [creator](http://twitter.com/landakram).

Before I go, I'm leaving you with some [[Acknowledgements]]. I wouldn't be possible without all of the amazing [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) out there. Speaking of which, I'm completely open source too! If you want more info about me and how you can contribute, here's my [special place on the Internet](https://github.com/landakram/kiwi).

Again, after you've read through all these pages, feel free to delete them and start fresh.

^[1]: You can also show your pages chronologically (by when you last edited) by **tapping the title of the page** (i.e. Home) in the navigation bar. You can search through all of your pages there too.
